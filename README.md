# Fractals
This project contains three methods that work together to model the Mandelbrot set in a window.

## Features
The Simple class creates the window, the Complex class contains methods to model and perform operations on complex numbers, 
and the SimpleBitMap class uses these operations to draw the Mandelbrot set in the window.
